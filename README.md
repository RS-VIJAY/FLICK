# FLICK

Barcode scanning is something which we see in our day to day life. It is maily used in billing counters of shopping areas where the barcode is scanned to get the information about the project easily. It has made billing process so easy but the equipment is very expensive. Mid scale and small scale vendors cannot afford to buy that kit. So we have developed a 2d barcode scanner called flick. It can be easily installed on any android phone and can be used to collect information. Our app is fast and completely reliable
